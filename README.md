Capstone project for Group 8, Camping Community

    The demand for camping is currently higher than ever. There are many different reasons that one may choose to go camping. Some like to disconnect from technology and reconnect with nature. Some families go camping to revitalize their relationships, away from all the distractions at home. Many youth organizations teach young people how to build a fire, pitch a tent, or read a compass. Camping means different things to different people, Camping Community aims to make it easier to find engaging camping experiences.
